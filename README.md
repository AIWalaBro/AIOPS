## An intelligent quiz generation platform powered by LLMs for personalized learning experiences

## Overview

AI Study Buddy is an innovative educational tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized quizzes on any topic. Built with Streamlit for an intuitive user interface and powered by Groq's LLM API, this application creates dynamic learning experiences tailored to different difficulty levels and question types.

The platform supports multiple question formats including Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and Fill-in-the-Blank questions, making it versatile for various learning scenarios. With built-in retry mechanisms, comprehensive logging, and result tracking capabilities, AI Study Buddy ensures reliable quiz generation and meaningful learning analytics.

## Problem Statement
